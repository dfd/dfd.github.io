          <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I occasionally read items that inspire ideas for blog posts.  Sometimes they are items I disagree with, and sometimes those items are behind logins.  I also want to avoid strawman arugments, so I'll want to link to examples of what I'm referring to.</p>
<p>In these situations, the guideline I plan to follow is to not name the author of the post which I am critical of, unless that person is otherwise somewhat famous in their field (e.g. the author of a book).</p>
<p>In any case, when I am critiquing someone's ideas, I never intend to imply anything negative about them as a person, scholar, or employee, unless explicitly stated.  Usually in these cases, the person has simply posted an example of the type of thinking I disagree with.</p>
